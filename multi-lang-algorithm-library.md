Let's create a repo that contains the most useful/popular algorithms (sorting/searching/etc) in all our favourite languages.

File structure:
```
repo
  |\
  | algorithm1
  |           \
  |            algorithm1.c
  |            algorithm1.hs
   \
    algorithm2
              \
               algorithm2.c
```
